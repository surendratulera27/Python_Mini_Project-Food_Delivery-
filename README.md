# Python_Mini_Project/Food_Delivery
This project aims to help food lovers to identify quality of restaurants that offer the best value for money, explore and analyze real-world restaurant data to discover the best-rated, most cost-effective, and cuisine specific dining options in their locality.

Using EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis), we will uncover patterns in restaurant offerings, pricing, ratings, service availability, and geographical distribution. The end goal is to empower users with insights that can drive smarter food decisions based on factual data rather than personal recommendations.

Learning Objectives : Upon completing this project, learners will be able to
● Understand the fundamentals of structured EDA using libraries numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
● Identify and handle missing or inconsistent data. 
● Explore correlations between variables like cost, rating, and popularity.
● Perform feature engineering (e.g creating a "region" column) 
● Use Python to generate visual insights from real-world data.
