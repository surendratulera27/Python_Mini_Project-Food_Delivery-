# Python_Mini_Project/Food_Delivery
This project aims to help food lovers to identify quality of restaurants that offer the best value for money, explore and analyze real-world restaurant data to discover the best-rated, most cost-effective, and cuisine specific dining options in their locality.

Using EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis), we will uncover patterns in restaurant offerings, pricing, ratings, service availability, and geographical distribution. The end goal is to empower users with insights that can drive smarter food decisions based on factual data rather than personal recommendations.

Learning Objectives : Upon completing this project, learners will be able to
● Understand the fundamentals of structured EDA using libraries numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
● Identify and handle missing or inconsistent data. 
● Explore correlations between variables like cost, rating, and popularity.
● Perform feature engineering (e.g creating a "region" column) 
● Use Python to generate visual insights from real-world data.

Step by step proccess:
Import the libraries -> Load the uncleaned dataset -> EDA -> Data cleaning -> Data visualization -> Feature engineering -> Export the cleaned dataset

Insights :
1.Using wordcloud, most of the customer prefer North Indian, South Indian, Chinese & Fast Food cuisines.
2.Using wordcloud, key highlights -> Take away, indoor seating & AC.
3.Chennai having the max. number of restuarents.
4.Average cost for 2-person is Rs.500
5.Using correaltion->rating is not highly depend on cost.
